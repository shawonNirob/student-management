Generic single-database configuration.

Alembic is a database migration tool that helps to manage changes to the database schema without losing data. 
It's built on top of SQLAlchemy and ensures that the database structure stays in sync with the SQLAlchemy models.

# How to use Alembic

1. Initialize the migration directory
```
alembic init alembic
```

2. Create a new migration
```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"
```

3. Apply the migration
```
alembic upgrade head
```

4. Rollback the last migration
```
alembic downgrade -1
```

5. List all migrations
```
alembic history
```

6. Show the current revision
```
alembic current
```
